## 6 Different Strategies The 6's R
1. Rehosting - **lift-and-shift.**
2. Replatforming  - **lift-tinker-and-shift**
3. Repurchasing  -  **Moving to a different product.**
4. Refactoring / Re-architecting - **Re-imagining how the application is architected and developed, typically using cloud-native features.**
5. Retire - **Get rid of**
6. Retain - **revisit or do nothing (for now**

### Rehosting
- Its means that the migration is done through tools like  [CloudEndure Migration, AWS VM Import/Export] while migration also done via Manual.

- Applications are easier to optimize/re-architect once they’re already running in the cloud. Partly because your organization will have developed better skills to do so, and partly because the hard part — migrating the application, data, and traffic — has already been done.

## Replatforming 
Migrating your application to a fully managed platform like Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.

##  Repurchasing
move to a SaaS platform like already Build Platforms and you can use it
For Example
- CRM to Salesforce.com
- HR system to Workday
# Refactoring / Re-architecting
- This is typically driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application’s existing environment.
- Migration of the application from monolithic architecture to Serverless Enviorment.
- Most expensive pattern, but, if you have a good product-market fit, it can also be the most beneficial.

## Retire
Closing the Infrastructure the System

## Retain
Didnot migrated the Updgraded System,or not inclined to migrate some applications
