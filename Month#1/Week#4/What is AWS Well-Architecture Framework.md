# What is AWS Well-Architecture Framework
- This Framework helps us learn architectural best practices for designing and operating secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the AWS Cloud.
- This Framework helps us to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.

## Pillars of AWS Well-Architected Framework
1. Operational Excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Cost Optimization
6. Sustainability

### Operational Excellence
Supporting to run workloads perfectly with the continueous updation with the help of Process and Procedures to deliver values.
### Security
Data Protection, Encryption thats help you to secure your data.
### Reliability
Performs the Functionality perfactly that includes ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle.
### Performance Efficiency
use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements,  maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
### Cost Optimization
Run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
### Sustainability
continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.


## Terms Used  in AWS Well-Architected Framework
1. **Component**
- code
- configuration
- AWS Resources
2. **Workload**
- identify a set of components that together deliver business value.
-  A workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about.
3. **Architecture**
- how components work together in a workload.
-  How components communicate and interact is often the focus of architecture diagrams.
4. **Milestones** 
- key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle
5. **Technology portfolio**
- collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate.

## Technology architecture teams**
- Technical Architect (infrastructure)
- Solutions Architect (software)
- Data Architect
- Networking Architect
- Security Architect.

### Enterprise Architecture.
- TOGAF
- Zachman-Framework

### Best Practice 
Creating Team and Distributing Work instead of working in the centralized way

## General Design Principles
- **Stop guessing your capacity needs**
Instead of focusing the Resources you can focus on the deployement and dealing with the Performance.You can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically.
- **Test systems at production scale**
you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and terminate the server for saving the cost.
- **Automate to make architectural experimentation easier**
Automation allows you to create and replicate your workloads at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort
- **Allow for evolutionary architectures**
Architectural decisions are often implemented as static, onetime events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime.
- **Drive architectures using data**
You can collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload.
- **Improve through game days**
Daily schedule the Test and simulate the the events in production, This will show that where did you need improvements.
