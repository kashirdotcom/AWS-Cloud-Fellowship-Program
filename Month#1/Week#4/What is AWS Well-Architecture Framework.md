# What is AWS Well-Architecture Framework
- This Framework helps us learn architectural best practices for designing and operating secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the AWS Cloud.
- This Framework helps us to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.

## Pillars of AWS Well-Architected Framework
1. Operational Excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Cost Optimization
6. Sustainability

### Operational Excellence
Supporting to run workloads perfectly with the continueous updation with the help of Process and Procedures to deliver values.
### Security
Data Protection, Encryption thats help you to secure your data.
### Reliability
Performs the Functionality perfactly that includes ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle.
### Performance Efficiency
use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements,  maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
### Cost Optimization
Run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
### Sustainability
continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.


## Terms Used  in AWS Well-Architected Framework
1. **Component**
- code
- configuration
- AWS Resources
2. **Workload**
- identify a set of components that together deliver business value.
-  A workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about.
3. **Architecture**
- how components work together in a workload.
-  How components communicate and interact is often the focus of architecture diagrams.
4. **Milestones** 
- key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle
5. **Technology portfolio**
- collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate.

## Technology architecture teams**
- Technical Architect (infrastructure)
- Solutions Architect (software)
- Data Architect
- Networking Architect
- Security Architect.

### Enterprise Architecture.
- TOGAF
- Zachman-Framework

### Best Practice 
Creating Team and Distributing Work instead of working in the centralized way
