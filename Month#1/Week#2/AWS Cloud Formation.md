# AWS Cloud Formattion
- It is a service that helps modelling and setting up AWS resources so that a developer can spend less time managing those resources and focus more on the applications.
- The template is created describing all the resources needed (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuration. 

## CloudFormation helps in following ways
### Simplify infrastructure management
Cloud Formation simplifies the overall infrastructure management. 
We only need to make a cloudformation template that has details of all the resources and their properties, this template is then converted into a stack that make all the resources available and running, and when we are done with the resources we can simple delete the stack that will automatically delete all the resources within the template.
### Quickly replicate your infrastructure
Use the same cloud formation template and replicate in the other region without the hasle of configuring multiple resources in the separate region.
### Easily control and track changes to your infrastructure
Cloud Formation templates are simplem text files which can be easily used to track chnges in thee infrastructure.
We can use a version control system to track changes in the template and can ealiy revert to the previous template settings.
