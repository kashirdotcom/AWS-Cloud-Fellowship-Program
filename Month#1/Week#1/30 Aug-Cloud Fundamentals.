##Traditional Architecture
The Traditional architecture is the modern technology which uses the new methods for the problem solving like if the house is made of mud many years ago now the houses are build up of the cements, bricks, as its cost but reliable. 
Example from the IT: 
As some years ago developer uses the html,css to build the website but now a days developer uses the modern technology such as React, Node js which takes time less and used everywhere. Its easy and reliable.


##Problems that I have identified

    1. Unable to update/improve the system
    2. unable to handle the system if there is no senior level person (skillwise in the team).
    3. if infrastructure fail, the business will go to loss



##Cloud Computing

In my words cloud computing is the term used for connecting through the virtual machine over internet. Its the on demand proving resources which will follow use and pay procedure. 


##Cloud vs Traditional Architecture

We did not take the tension of the resources in the cloud as all of the resources (hardware) are managed by the service provider but in the traditional we will focus on hardware failure etc problems.



##Characteristics of Cloud Computing

The characteristics of the cloud computing are

###1. On Demand
The customer uses the resources and pay per minute as the customer didnâ€™t needed to buy resources.
###2.Broad Network Access
It means we can use this from anywhere no matter which location it is.

3.Resources Pooling
if the customer A used the resources and terminate the resources and customer B use the same resources in simple, single resources are consumed by multiple customers.

##Why Cloud

For example a application running on the cloud and its version is 1.0.0
 and its takes 20 GB Storage and when the team upgrade the system to 2.0.0 and its size is 100 Gb the customer simply attach the storage to it, its easier to scale and its more flexible.
If the customer uses 2 region and the data is sync with both region, suppose that one region faces the disaster so the customer data will not be lost.


##Cloud Service Models

In IaaS we have access to the hardware also, but this model has the lot of complexity in such a way that we can configure all the parts of hardware also.

In PaaS, we run the applications  and resources managed by the the service providers. The developer will focus on the application which they are developing.


In SaaS, we only upload files to the server and server make it possible to attach resources with them and managed by the service providers
Example Github is a tool we upload to the website to the server and assigned a name abc.io and when we search through abc.io the website opened.

####Public Cloud 
Its free, and used by anyone

####Private Cloud
Used by the company or domains, such as we have the window server and students can access through  domain login.


####Hybrid Cloud
Collection of public and private cloud
