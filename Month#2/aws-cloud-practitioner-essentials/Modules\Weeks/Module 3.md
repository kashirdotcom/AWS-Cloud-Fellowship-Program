# AWS Global Infrastructure benefits, describe Availability Zones, communicate the benefits of Amazon CloudFront and compare methods for provisioning AWS services
## Availability Zones
single data center or a group of data centers within a Region. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other.
## Edge Locations
An edge location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.
## Ways to Interact with AWS Services
- AWS Management Console
   - web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. 
   - You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym.
   -  The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks.
- AWS Command Line Interface
    - AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool. AWS CLI is available for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- AWS SDK
  - SDKs enable you to use AWS services with your existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS. 
 
 # AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CloudFormation
 provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:

- Adjust capacity

- Load balancing

- Automatic scaling

- Application health monitoring

# AWS CloudFormation
- We build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision resources.

- AWS CloudFormation provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, enabling you to frequently build your infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions or write custom scripts. It determines the right operations to perform when managing your stack and rolls back changes automatically if it detects errors.
