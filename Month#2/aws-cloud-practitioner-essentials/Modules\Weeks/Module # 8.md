- Always Free
AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month. Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month.
- 12 Months Free

- Trials ( offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period.)

## Billing Dashboard
Use the AWS Billing & Cost Management dashboard to pay your AWS bill, monitor your usage, and analyze and control your costs.

- Compare your current month-to-date balance with the previous month, and get a forecast of the next month based on current usage.

## AWS Budgets
- In AWS Budgets, you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.

## AWS Cost Explorer
- AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that enables you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.
- AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data. For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.
