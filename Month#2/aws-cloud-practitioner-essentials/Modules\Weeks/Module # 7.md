# Monitoring and Analytics
## Amazon CloudWatch
- **Amazon CloudWatch** is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics.
- CloudWatch uses metrics to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time.

## CloudWatch Alarms
 CloudWatch Alarms that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold. 
 
 ## AWS CloudTrail
 AWS CloudTrail records API calls for your account.
 In the CloudTrail Event History section, the owner applies a filter to display only the events for the “CreateUser” API action in IAM.
 
 ## CloudTrail Insights
 This optional feature allows CloudTrail to automatically detect unusual API activities in your AWS account. 
 
 ## AWS Trusted Advisor
 AWS Trusted Advisor is a web service that inspects your AWS environment and provides real-time recommendations in accordance with AWS best practices.
 When you access the Trusted Advisor dashboard on the AWS Management Console, you can review completed checks for cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits.

For each category:

   - The green check indicates the number of items for which it detected **no problems.**

   - The orange triangle represents the number of recommended **investigations.**

   - The red circle represents the number of recommended **actions.**
